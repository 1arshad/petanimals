	<h2>1.Companion dog</h2><br>

	<div id="para"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A companion dog is a dog that does not work, providing only companionship as a pet, rather than usefulness by doing specific tasks. Many of the toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure of their company, not as workers. Any dog can be a companion dog, and many working types such as retrievers are enjoyed primarily for their friendly nature as a family pet, as are mixed breed dogs. The American Kennel Club also offers a Companion dog title for judged dog obedience competitions.<br><br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Breed groups argue that any dog in the working group type is inherently a "working" dog, while others argue that only a dog with an active occupation, either in a breed-related field (such as water trials for retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs) or in a breed-nonspecific field that requires training and discipline, such as being assistance dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.<br><br>

     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dogs that have been chosen for traits that make a convenient pet are generally smaller breeds, and the tradition of keeping pretty dogs for no purpose other than to be court decorations stems back thousands of years to Chinese nobility. The Pekingese and the Pug are both examples of canines chosen for their ability to be pets. In the case of the Pekingese, it was for their lion-like demeanor; for the Pugs, it was for their "lucky" wrinkles and their monkey-like face.

	<h2>2.Working dog</h2><br>
	<img src="images/working dog.jpg"><br><br>
	<div id="para">
	<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A working dog is a canine working animal, i.e., a type of dog that is not merely a pet but learns and performs tasks to assist and/or entertain its human companions, or a breed of such origin. In Australia and New Zealand, a working dog is one which has been trained to work livestock, irrespective of its breeding.
    This Komondor is guarding sheep.	<br><br>
    Within this general description, however, there are several ways in which the phrase is used.<br>	<br>
	 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To identify any dog that performs actions on a regular basis to assist people. In this context, a dog that helps a rancher manage cattle or that performs stunts for a trainer who receives pay for its acts is a working dog, as is a service dog or an assistance dog. This might be in comparison to a companion dog, whose purpose is primarily as a pet.

     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To distinguish between dogs that are bred for appearance primarily to win conformation shows and working dogs that are bred primarily for their ability to perform a task. For example, a Border Collie that is a conformation champion is not necessarily a good sheepdog and a Border Collie that is a champion at sheepdog trials might not succeed in show rings for its nonstandard appearance. It is also possible that a specimen may excel in both appearance and performance. In many FCI countries it is impossible for some working breeds' dogs to become conformation champions without having passed adequate breed specific tests measuring their working abilities.</p>

	<h2>3.Dog crossbreed</h2><br>
	<img src="images/dog crossbreed.jpg"><br><br>
	<div id="para">
	<p>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crossbreed dogs or designer dogs are dogs which have been intentionally bred from two or more recognized dog breeds and not from dogs with no purebred ancestors, but have not been artificially bred to each other enough to breed true and be recognized as a breed in their own right.<br><br>
	The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica traces the term "designer dog" to the late 20th century, when breeders began to cross purebred poodles with other purebred breeds in order to obtain a dog with the poodles' hypoallergenic coat, along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds.<br><br>

    
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The primary identifying mark of a crossbred "designer dog" is that the resulting puppies are called by a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from the breed names of the two purebred parents, such as Schnoodle (Schnauzer and poodle cross).[1] or Shepsky (German Shepherd/Siberian Husky cross). Other purebred breeds are being crossed to provide designer dogs described with an endless range of created labels, such as the Puggle (Pug and Beagle cross). There are even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner, such as German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog, Husky, Chow Chow).<br><br>

	
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like children in a family, a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other, even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of purebreds. Often even pups in the same litter will look quite different.</p>

	<h2>4.Guard dog</h2><br>
	<img src="images/guard dog.jpg"><br><br>
	<div id="para">
	<p>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A guard dog or watch dog (not to be confused with the attack dog) is a dog used to guard against, and watch for unwanted or unexpected people or animals.The dog is discriminating so that it does not annoy or attack familiar people.<br><br>
    Both guard dogs and watchdogs bark loudly to alert their owners of an intruder's presence and to scare away the intruder. The watch dog's function ends here; a guard dog is capable of attacking, or restraining the intruder.<br><br>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livestock guardian dogs are often large enough, 100-200 lbs and strong enough to attack and drive away livestock predators such as wolves. Some smaller breeds (such as Keeshond and Tibetan Terrier) are excellent watchdogs but not guard dogs because they bark loudly to alert their masters of intruders but are physically small and not given to assertive behavior. Guardian breeds will bark to alert their master and to warn off an approaching animal, or human threat, prior to their interception of the trespasser. They are different from the smaller watchdogs in that they do not continue barking, they take action. The human shepherd would in many cases come to the guard dog's aid with a weapon, not letting the dog fend for itself.</p>

	<h2>5.Mountain dog</h2><br>
	<img src="images/mountain dog.jpg"><br><br>
	<div id="para">
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mountain dogs are a generic form of dog, a group of similar or related dog breeds or landraces typically from the mountain environs of central Eurasia.<br><br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are often a working dog, particularly a livestock or flock guardian or a farm dog. By and large, these dogs tend to have claimed Molosser dogs in their genetic heritage.Most have a double coat.</p>
