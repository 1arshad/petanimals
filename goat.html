	<h2>1.Appenzell goat</h2><br>

	<div id="para">
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Appenzell, French: Chèvre d’Appenzell, German: Appenzellerziege, is a rare and endangered indigenous breed of long-haired white domestic goat from Switzerland. It originates in the "half-cantons" of the historic Appenzell region, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden, and has spread into the neighbouring Canton of St. Gallen.<br><br>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Documentation of the Appenzell breed goes back more than 100 years. A goat-breeders' association, the Ziegenzuchtgenossenschaft Appenzell, was founded in Innerrhoden in February 1902, and another, the Ziegenzuchtgenossenschaft Urnäsch, in Ausserrhoden in 1914. The Schweizerischer Ziegenzuchtverband, the Swiss federation of cantonal goat breeders' associations, runs a conservation and recovery project for the Appenzell which includes financial support for breeders and a controlled breeding programme.In 2007 conservation status of the breed was listed by the FAO as "endangered-maintained".<br><br>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 2005, the Appenzell breed represented about 4.2% of the total registered Swiss goat population of about 70,000 head.[3] At the end of 2013 a population of 1900–2000 was reported to DAD-IS.

	<h2>2.Australian Cashmere goat</h2><br>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Australian Cashmere goat is a breed of Cashmere domestic goats originating in Australia. Whilst retaining the fertility and hardiness of the bush goat, the Australian Cashmere is quite different in appearance and temperament. In midwinter, it has an excellent overall coverage of long, dense cashmere.<br><br>


		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goats were liberated on the islands off the coast of Australia by Dutch and Portuguese navigators long before the British settlement of Australia. The introduced goats came from a great variety of backgrounds and they acclimatised readily to the Australian environment. Most pre-1830 prints of early Australia show the animals on the hills in the background as goats. Some early efforts were made to develop a goat fleece industry in Australia. William Riley, in 1832 imported "Angora-Cachemire" animals to his property, Raby, New South Wales. In that year, he delivered a paper to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of New South Wales in an effort to encourage the development of a Cashmere/Angora fleece industry in Australia. A further 150 years were needed for Australian graziers to develop some of his concepts. An advertisement also appeared in 1832 in the Western Australia publication "Colonial Paper" for young half-bred Cashmere bucks offered for sale at three pounds each by W. Tanner of Caversham.</p>

	<div id="para">
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Barbari or Bari is a breed of small domestic goat found in a wide area in India and Pakistan. It is distributed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in India, and in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan.<br><br>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Barbari goat gets its name from Berbera, a coastal city located on the Indian ocean in Somalia.[6] The Barbari is one of 20 classified breeds in India and is most commonly found in the north-western arid and semi-arid regions.[7] It is distributed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in India, and in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan.[3]:361[4][5] It is also reported from Mauritius, Nepal and Vietnam.[8] The world population is estimated at about 2.4 million, of which almost all are in Pakistan.</p>

	<h2>4.Boer goat</h2><br>
	<img src="images/Boer goat.jpg"><br><br>
	<div id="para">
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Boer goat is a breed of goat that was developed in South Africa in the early 1900s for meat production. Their name is derived from the Afrikaans (Dutch) word boer, meaning farmer. Boer goats are a popular breed for meat.<br><br>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Boer goat was probably bred from the indigenous South African goats of the Namaqua, San, and Fooku tribes, with some crossing of Indian and European bloodlines being possible. They were selected for meat rather than milk production; due to selective breeding and improvement, the Boer goat has a fast growth rate and excellent carcass qualities, making it one of the most popular breeds of meat goat in the world. Boer goats have a high resistance to disease and adapt well to hot, dry semideserts. United States production is centered in west-central Texas, particularly in and around San Angelo and Menard. The original US breeding stock came from herds located in New Zealand. Only later were they imported directly from Africa.<br><br>

			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Boer goats commonly have white bodies and distinctive brown heads. Some Boer goats can be completely brown or white or paint, which means large spots of a different color are on their bodies. Like the Nubian goat, they possess long, pendulous ears. They are noted for being docile, fast-growing, and having high fertility rates. Does are reported to have superior mothering skills as compared to other breeds. Boer goats tend to gain weight at about the same rate as their sire, so a buck from a proven fast-growing bloodline will command the highest price, as its offspring will tend to also be fast growers. The primary market for slaughter goats is a 22–36 kg (49–79 lb) kid; kids should reach marketable size at weaning age. The kid of a proven fast-growing sire might weigh 36 kg (79 lb) at 90 days, while the kid of a poor-quality sire might weigh only 15 kg (33 lb) at 90 days. An average-quality buck will initially be less expensive to purchase, but it can significantly undermine an operation's long-term profitability.</p>

	<h2>5.Dutch Landrace goat</h2><br>
	<img src="images/Dutch Landrace goat.jpg"><br><br>
	<div id="para">
		<p>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Dutch Landrace goat breed is one of the original breeds found in the Netherlands. It is related to other northwest European "Landrace"-named goat breeds. There is a herd of approximately 1000 used on national reserves to keep naturally open areas free of trees.<br><br>


			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Dutch Landrace goat was dying out by the mid 20th century and only had a few left in the world as of 1958. A breeding program was designed to save the breed and since then has built the breed back up to 2000 that are registered in the LFNL herd book (National Association of Dutch Feral Goat Breeders).</p>
