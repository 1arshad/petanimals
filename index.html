<p ><strong>1.Shih Tzu :-</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A small dog with long hair. The arrogant expression muzzle along with smooth <br>movements arrogant give representatives of this breed aristocratic look. No wonder it is <br>considered that, initially, these dogs are bred only for the sake of the emperor. Despite the<br> small size Shih Tzu – this is not a decorative dog. His character is quite complex, and <br>intelligence several times this figure rises in dogs of other breeds.</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shih Tzu does not require strong physical exertion. Therefore, the representative of the <br>breed is considered to be an ideal pet for those who live in the apartment. However, the fresh <br>air is still useful for dogs, and therefore 2-3 walks a week, you can still perform. Representatives<br> of this breed is almost odorless “skunk”. A long hair shedding will not be a particular problem <p>with regular wet cleaning.</p>

	<p> <strong id="cat">2.Cat :-</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet; or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact. A house cat is valued by humans for<br> companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.<br>

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision.Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.<br><br>

	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control.</p><br>

    			<strong id="goat">3.Goat :-</strong><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The domestic goat or simply goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of C. aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the goat—antelope subfamily Caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, and have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world. Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.<br>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males are called bucks or billies and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids. Castrated males are called wethers. While the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a goat-like quality, hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats.<br>

               In 2011, there were more than 924 million goats living in the world, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

    			<strong id="horse">4.Horse :-</strong><br>
    			<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.<br>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.</p>

                <strong>5.Cattle :-</strong>
                <p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cattle—colloquially cows—are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus.<br>

                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. They are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements). Another product of cattle is dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious meaning. Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu, are also kept as pets.<br>

                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Around 10,500 years ago, cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in central Anatolia, the Levant and Western Iran. According to an estimate from 2011, there are 1.4 billion cattle in the world. In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome. Some consider cattle the oldest form of wealth, and cattle raiding consequently one of the earliest forms of theft.</p>

                <strong>6.Bull :-</strong>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated) adult male of the species Bos taurus (cattle). More muscular and aggressive than the female of the species, the cow, the bull has long been an important symbol in many cultures, and plays a significant role in both beef ranching and dairy farming, and in a variety of other cultural activities.<br>

                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The female counterpart to a bull is a cow, while a male of the species who has usually been castrated is a steer, ox or bullock, although in North America this last term refers to a young bull[citation needed], and in Australia to a draught animal. Usage of these terms varies considerably with area and dialect. Colloquially, people unfamiliar with cattle may refer to both castrated and intact animals as "bulls".</p>

                 <strong>7.Angora Goat :-</strong><br>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Angora goat has been regarded by some as a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor (Capra falconeri). They have been in the region since around the Paleolithic. Angora goats were depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50 lira banknotes of 1938–1952.<br>
                    <br>
                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fleece taken from an Angora goat is called mohair. A single goat produces between four and five kilograms of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year. Angoras, despite their coats, are not directly related to sheep.<br>

               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turkey, Argentina, the United States, and South Africa are the top producers of mohair. Secondary producers include New Zealand and Australia. For a long time, Angora goats were bred for their white coats. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Now, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fibers.<br>

               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Angora goats are more susceptible to external parasites (ectoparasites) than similar animals, as their coats are denser. They are not prolific breeders, nor are they considered very hardy, being particularly delicate during the first few days of life. Further, Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor-quality diet will curtail mohair development.</p>
